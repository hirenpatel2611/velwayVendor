# simple-hoc-validator

Simple rule-based validation HOC

This is a very simple HOC, for someone who wants to do _simple_ validations on React components. If you need advanced stuff, this is not it :) This was not made with performance in mind either, so...

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save simple-hoc-validator
```

## Usage

```js

import React from 'react';
import withValidation from 'simple-hoc-validator';

const rules = [
  {
    field: 'name',
    condition: value => value !== null && value !== undefined && value !== '',
    error: 'Name is empty'
  }, {
    field: 'password',
    condition: (value, obj) => value === obj.compare_password,
    error: "Passwords don't match"
  }
];

class MyFormComponent extends React.Component {
  onSubmit() {
    if (this.props.isValid(this.state)) {
      submit();
    }
  }

  render() {
    const errors = this.props.validate(this.state);

    if (errors.name) {
      showNameError();
    }

    if (errors.password) {
      showPasswordError();
    }
  }
}

export default withValidation(rules)(MyFormComponent);
```
